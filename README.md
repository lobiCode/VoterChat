VoterChat
=========

VoterChat will be a future Android app that is similar to Whatsapp-But it will stop ALL power abuse. To have someone join the group chat, 50% of people must want the person to be in it. There is no one default admin, everyone is an admin. If someone wants to kick someone, they start a vote. 

Features that will be implemented
	-A secure democracy-type group chat with no logging. 
	-No power abuse.
	-A way to chat without texting.
